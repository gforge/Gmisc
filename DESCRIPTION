Title: A few plots, tables, and misc functions
Author: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Maintainer: Max Gordon <max@gforge.se>
Description: This is a collection of functions for tables, plots, and more.
    For tables you'll find the convenient htmlTable that I have used for
    advanced markdown-compatible table layout. A major focus has been to
    have it compatible with LibreOffice (you can copy/past from there
    into word). The plots are transitionPlot and forestplot2. Apart from
    those you will find a few handy functions for formatting p-values,
    generating the basic stats for your table 1, etc.
