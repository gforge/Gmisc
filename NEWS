Changes for 0.5.7.4
-------------------
* Externalized many of the forestplot2 functions and added the option of having a set line height
* Added new_page option for grid-based plots
* Updated the simpleRmsAnova function

Changes for 0.5.7.3
-------------------
* Removed the plot.new() from transitionplot, this is in order to allow splitting plots, adding it to a viewport etc.

Changes for 0.5.7.2
-------------------
* Added the lineheight option for forestplot2
* Fixed the R CMD Check --as-cran to run without any objections
* Updated dependencies

Changes for 0.5.7.1
-------------------
* Fixed rownames in printCrudeAndAdjusted
* Changed printCrudeAndAdjusted to return a matrix subclass instead of immediately printing
* Ran through som Pkg-check and hopefully cleared out some bugs

Changes for 0.5.7.0
-------------------
* getCrudeAndAdjusted is now an S3 method that has a default method and a method for rms objects. The rms relies on rms:::summaryrms and returns a matrix that is pruned and used for the situation.
* printCrudeAndAdjusted has externalized a lot of its functions and handling of the new rms getCrudeAndAdjusted output 
* printCrudeAndAdjusted now ignores any interaction variables

Changes for 0.5.6.1
-------------------
* forestplot2 fix so that it properly handles data.frames as arguments
* printCrudeAndAdjustedModel has a better handling of the groups argument
* Improved import to importFrom

Changes for 0.5.6.0
-------------------
* The forestplot2 is updated - the widths are now relative to the window size, there is a margin option, and many of the inside functions have moved to helpers outside. Also fixed the alignment of the summary label to work better.
* Fixed a minor bug for cgroup without rowlabels
* Added default_ref for both getDescriptionStatsBy and describeProp function. 
* The percentage sign in getDescriptionStatsBy, describProp and describeFactors is now optional.
* A minor bug fix for cgroup.just for the htmlTable function
 
Changes for 0.5.4.5
-------------------
* Minor fix to rownames in htmlTable... again.
* Had to remove the "terms" option from the plotHR rms:::cph() alternative as it did caused an error
** The error seems to stem from predictrms() where the Adjto function deletes the adjto output in:
** adjto <- if (int.pres) 
**        model.matrix(Terms.ns, adjto)[, -1, drop = FALSE]
** I will have to look into it one day...

Changes for 0.5.4.4
-------------------
* Fixed a rowname problem for htmlTable
* Changed the rowlabel.pos to be by default at the bottom, seems more natural with multi-layered tables.

Changes for 0.5.4.3
-------------------
* Fixed a caption problem for htmlTable

Changes for 0.5.4.2
